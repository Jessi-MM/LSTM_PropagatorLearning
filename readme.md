## Data Generation üìä
LSTM model uses wave packet and potential at time $t$ as input and returns the wave packet at time $t+ \Delta t$ under potential given. We used an LSTM model because we view this problem as a time series problem.

To generate wave packets $\psi(r,t)$ propagated through time we applied the DVR method to solve the Time Dependent Schr√∂dinger Equation, using the *Proton Transfer System* as model of potential. We used a grid of $n=32$ points in the position space $[a=-1.5, b=1.5]\mathring{A}$, each step of time was $\Delta t= 1 fs$, and generated trajectories of $200fs$ (this is the sequence of length to the LSTM). The next figure shows an example of what contains one trajectory.

The notebook to generate data is in `src/Proton_Transfer_DataGenerate.ipynb` and contains a guide to use the class.

## Results and Predictions üìà
The trained model was saved in: `src/ANN_Models/4700Data_LSTM_MODEL2/14-05-23_10EPOCHS.pth`   

To compare our results, we used $|S|$ and $\theta$ parameters of the accuracy function:  
$$S=\langle \psi_{LSTM}|\psi_{True}\rangle = |S|e^{i \theta}$$     
which compares the two wavefunction, the expected $\psi_{True}$ and the predicted with the LSTM model $\psi_{LSTM}$. If we have two equal wavefunction, given that they are normalised, it follows that:   
$$\langle \psi|\psi\rangle = \int_a^b dr\psi(r) \psi(r)^\dagger = \int_a^b|\psi(r)|dr = 1 = |S|e^{i\theta} \iff |S|=1\text{ and }\theta=0$$     
We obtained an average magnitude accuracy of $|S|=0.946$ and an average phase accuracy of $\theta=0.0001$  over a test set with 800 trajectories. The next figures shows some predictions by LSTM model.
